# BetterChatRoom

Poorly put together README; the goal of this project is to set up a lan ftp system that also doubles as a lan chatroom. 
This relies on a MEAN stack, but @yanggao is doing front end and I (wilgao) do backend

This project is currently deployed to Heroku here: https://chatroom8982.herokuapp.com
